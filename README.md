Advent of Code is a fun online coding challenge of 2 exercises per day from December 1-25, stressing a variety of general coding concepts. 

In 2020 I completed 13.5 days of the challenge. My solutions (in Python) are contained in this repo, and the original problems are available at https://adventofcode.com
